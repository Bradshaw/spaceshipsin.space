# Burden RPG

Burden is a short-ish form roleplaying game about a dangerous journey.

The main quest, to reach the **Monument**, is known from the start, and while other events, goals, and detours may punctuate the journey, reaching the monument remains the beacon that guides the story, and marks the end of the campaign.
