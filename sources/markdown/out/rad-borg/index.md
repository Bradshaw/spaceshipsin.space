# Räd Borg

Räd Borg is based upon, and compatible with Mörk Borg. See [legal](#legal) for more information.   
This document is a work in progress, entire chunks are missing, some parts are incomplete, and none of it has been properly tested.

About the name:
- It happens to spell "Raid Fort" in broken Swedish, a happy coincidence
- The player character are totally rädical adventurers in an irrädiated wasteland

About the tone:
- Play it fast, loose, loud, and stupid
- If Mörk Borg is doom metal, Räd Borg is skater punk
- Take existential dread and cosmic horror, soak it in epic beast-slaying fantasy, add a healthy dash of graffiti and teenage recklessness, and run wild
- If it makes sense while you're playing, but sounds ridiculous when you talk about it the next day, you're playing it right!

## Vibes

Colourful post-apocalypse. Riding the edge between gross-out and funny. 50/50 mix of medieval fantasy and post-collapse sci-fi.

Räd Borg takes place on the Wilderas continent on planet Meer. It is known that other continents lie somewhere across the gunky seas, beyond the glowing fog, but their names have been lost to time and war, as has most Wilderan and Meeran history.

Wilderas is mostly composed of feudal-like fiefdoms ruled over by monarchs, barons, and counts. The rulers are sometimes evil, sometimes arguably benevolent, and seemingly always on the precipice of going to war.

Scattered around Wilderas are dungeons. These dungeons sometimes have historical reasons for their existence, but they can equally have been created or just randomly appeared just to challenge whatever band of plucky adventurers happen to stumble upon them.

It is said that Voidmonger, the Hollow Space God, is on their way to Meer. Upon their arrival, they will smite all but the most righteously badass of the Meeran continents. The Prophesies of Gorâzoteth have began to come true. It is time for Wilderan adventurers to prove to Voidmonger that this continent is truly the most epic among the lands on Meer, perhaps even in the entire galaxy (if such a suggestion isn't blasphemous, of course).

#### The Crater

A vast irradiated crater speckled with crystal debris and shattered artifacts. Lifeforms torn from the bowels of Meer have developed on the surface of this scar.
The Cathedral of Loria stands tall at the center of the crater. Connecting the blighted ground to the swirling clouds, a white tower, every surface engraved with prayers. Within its walls, the Cult of Loria conducts its business, bringing offerings through a maze stairways and passages up to Loria's chambers at the tip of the spire. Her voice can be heard softly resonating from the walls, praying and offering guidance.

The Cathedral's foundations dig deep into the wound in the ground, leading to a dark and twisted system of caves that once formed the sprawling city of Martite. Ancient automatons slowly toil away, rebuilding the secret metropolis. Pockets of life exist in the tunnels and caverns. Some surviving districts, disconnected from one another, have continued to live as though Martite never fell. Other settlements can also be found. The descendants of lost explorers, refugees from a long-forgotten war, idealists looking to create societies that match their principles far from the influence of the surface's monarchs.

Ancient dungeons, protecting crystal artifacts and forgotten technologies, can be found hidden in the walls if one knows what they are looking for. Entering these dungeons is a reckless affair. Automated defenses, forgotten spells, and immortal guardians lie in wait, ready to unleash arcane magicks and swift violence upon any intruder.

### Things

#### Pilgrims and Wizards

Occasionally, a strange sickness befalls someone, and they are overcome with a need to travel. They begin walking the world, seemingly at random, in a strange state of calm introspection. These people are referred to as "p̗̼il̊͌͞grȉͅm̈́̓s". Some pilgrims are friendly, willing to travel with strangers for a while.   
Oth̥̃̐ers seem to fear strangers, fending them off with weapons and strange magicks. When a pilgrim's magi͏̵̀c̗̦̕ks grow strong enough, they find themself drawn to the Qharno Mountains, where they complete their pilgrimage, and become a "wizard".   
Wi̺ͨz̸̗̊a͔̋r͞d͑̐s are driven only by the fluctuations of m͏agick, fickle, unpredictable, and unstable. On a good day, a wizard may bestow great riches and pow͓̼̻e̴r̠͐s upon travellers who cross their path, but it is just as likely that they'll unleash a storm of arcane spells that te͏ars r͔̼ͩe̊aḻity apart around whomever is ul̬ͣ͡ũ̧̹ͭc̤͔k̞̥̖̺̋̀͊ny enough to catch their attention.   
People who dedicate their lives to the art of magick are not wizards. They call themselves mages, sorcerers, or casters. W͉ͥ̕į̴̛z̟a̡ͧ̋r̈ͪds are cͭ̂u̳r̵̰̺seͧd bȅ̾ͦin͇͐gͩs.
