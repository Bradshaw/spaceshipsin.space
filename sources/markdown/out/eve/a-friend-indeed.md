## An EVE Online story

I was at a point in my capsuleer career where the hustle-bustle of war and industry was starting to get to be a bit much.  
A few months had passed since our alliance had taken control of Catch, *The Jewel of Nullsec*, and began to make that jewel shine bright with our particular brand of joyful aggression. Fleets would come and go hourly, looking to rub shoulders with this fresh new band of misfits, and we would oblige, undocking our hordes of eager pilots to fight every single ship that approached us.  

Believe it or not, battling dozens of fleets every day, watching hundreds of ships explode into fire and shrapnel, it eventually gets old. And so, I bowed out of the chaos, and into the terror.  

Hungry for mystery and adventure, I joined some friends in their wormhole corporation.  
Most of the galaxy of New Eden is connected via *jump gates*, a network of star systems all tied together, spanning the galaxy, and forming the backbone of infrastructure, logistics, trade, industry, and war.  
But there are other connections between stars. Wormholes appear, randomly and fleetingly connecting star systems together, often leading to stars that are not reachable by the empires' jump gates.  

These uncharted, untameable stars are collectively known as *wormhole space*.  

I moved into a wormhole star system with  a handful of other capsuleers. We'd spend our days scanning for new wormholes, mapping out the ever-changing geography, making money collecting lost artifacts left behind by the mysterious *Sleepers* and acting as guides through shortcuts in wormhole space.

As for warfare, in wormhole space, information is everything. Cloaked ships scanning in the dark, taking down meticulous notes about structures, wormholes, and the glimpses of other ships when they're briefly forced to drop cloak.  
Everything silent and slow, except for sudden bursts of fire and brimstone when ships are caught unaware, and then silence again immediately after.  

This is where our story begins.
We had been feuding with another wormhole group. We'd actively seek out their home system and strike with hit & run attacks. We had spies in their system. They had spies in ours.  

One day, we stumble on an unexpected opportunity. A short route from our home to theirs. The route included a hop through empire space, using an allied jump bridge.  
This would allow us to go and attack them, without fearing them chasing us back home, since they didn't have the benefit of the bridge.  

We gear up. I pick a strategic cruiser. An expensive, but agile railgun platform with cloaking abilities.

We set out, and travel to their home system while scouts relentlessly scan the wormhole network around their system

As we approach our chosen target, one of our scouts begins to worry
Our opponents are behaving strangely, several ships are sitting there, uncloaked. One ship is warping around the system, cloaking and uncloaking erratically
We begin to get worried

Did they know we were here? Were they baiting us into a fight we couldn't win?

There was little to no chance they knew our exact numbers, so we decide to "counter-bait"

A quarter of our fleet drop cloak and begin to attack, forcing their hand so they'll hopefully spring their trap
The rest of us stay on hold, waiting for more information before deciding to attack or bail out

At that moment, a massive fleet of battleships is spotted by our escape scout, they're jumping through the wormholes that would lead us back to our allied bridge, threatening the integrity of the wormholes as they go

We're not going to win this fight, we need to bail
I decloak to snipe away the tackle frigates that are preventing the our engaged forces from escaping, we don't intend to leave anyone behind if we don't have to

Moments later our fleet is able to disengage, we warp away
With any luck we'll cross paths with the battleships, but we'll be able to jump out before they can follow us back through

The escape is a success (this kind of phrase doesn't sound quite as ironic as you might think, to an EVE Online player)
A success, except for one detail, one of the wormholes on the way back collapses as the ship before me jumps through

I'm stranded, alone, in a very expensive ship, with no scanning module equipped, in an uncharted star system of dubious hospitality


I cloak up, find a safe place to sit and think, and begin to gather myself
Right now, I'm safe, but I'm stuck
Time is on my side, but the circumstances are not
I decide to call it a night, power down the ship, and try to find my way home tomorrow...


I get back to the ship controls, power everything up, and begin to get my bearings
I use the basic scanning devices to see if there happen to be any uncloaked ships, and warp around to various planets, moons, and asteroid belts, hoping to get an idea of the people who live here

During one of my scans, an uncloaked Heron appears, still bearing the name it was given when it left the factory: "Carbon Blyde's Heron" (name changed because I don't remember the actual pilot's name)


The Heron disappears off of scan again...
Then a few minutes later, it pops back, and things start to click in my mind
The Heron is a cheap ship, used for disposable scouting, but also by fresh newbies, trying their luck at wormhole exploration


Because of the low-grade electronics, it can't fit the "Covert Ops"-spec cloaking devices that more advanced capsuleers depend on. The simpler cloaking device fit to this ship deactivates when the ship warps around through the star system


I look up Carbon Blyde's file, indeed they're a new capsuleer, still learning what it means to be effectively immortal, and trying to take their first few steps in the community
They belong to a young corporation, some other fresh faces, no doubt friends from their former lives


I send them a message, trying not to show my hand straight away, but letting them know that I need help

A few minutes later, they reply, a little confused, but ready to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement


They tell me that they too, are stranded. Not because they don't know their way out, but because they'd bitten off more than they could chew
After exploring a few wormholes in the area, they'd stumbled on and gathered some ancient relics, worth more money than they'd ever seen


But they had been spotted while doing so, and a fleet was waiting to ambush them on their way back home

We had little reason to trust each other, if true, they stood to lose as much as me, but how could I know for sure?

Regardless, I decide to trust them


We form a small, two-ship fleet, linking our navigation systems, and they're able to guide me to the first of three wormholes we'd need to jump through to find our way to safety

We discuss the situation and form a plan

Because I'd not had to drop cloak during all this, I had no reason to believe the ambushers had any idea who I was, what sort of ship I was flying, nor even that I would even be a factor
But on the flip side, I was the only combat-capable ship in our pair so I needed to take care


Carbon tells me everything they know about the ambush fleet
At a minimum, we're up against a few frigates and a destroyer, that I ought to be able to dispatch
They also have a battlecruiser and some repair ships, which might be an issue


Carbon's ship is small enough to be able to escape the battlecruiser's guns, but if the destroyer gets a bead on them, they'll not last long

We roll the dice, with any luck, the wormhole will spit us out in an advantageous position. We jump in


Luck is... weird...
Carbon's ship ends up on the edge of the warp disruption sphere that the ambushers have set up, *just about* out of range of the destroyer
On the other hand, I'm smack in the middle, within spitting distance of the battlecruiser and destroyer


We still have a few seconds of invisibility from the wormhole phasing, that we use to come up with a quick plan.
Carbon will move away from the sphere, feigning to warp to a wormhole in that direction, and when the frigates give chase, I will fly the other way and begin shooting


Big brain time baby!
As soon as Carbon moves, a few of the frigates warp away to the wormhole in an attempt to get there first, so I only have two frigates to take out with my long range railguns


Meanwhile I activate my stasis webifier on the destroyer, preventing it from getting in shooting range of Carbon
I don't know why, but Carbon didn't activate their afterburner, slowing their escape, which had the effect of baiting the destroyer into keeping up the chase


As I approach the edge of the sphere, the battlecruiser manages to take aim, and fire a full-power broadside with their short-range blasters right at me, my shields evaporate, my armour takes a beating too
I might survive another shot like this, but no more...


Carbon warps to our escape wormhole, as soon as I'm out of the sphere, I turn to follow, taking pot shots at the destroyer, hoping to take them out before they get close enough to tackle me
Another broadside, this time I'm at the edge of the blasters' range, but it still hurts...


My ship enters warp, and while my guns and defensive modules cool down, Carbon lets me know they're out, and the other side of the wormhole is safe
I jump through, and once reunited on the other side, we quickly make the next two wormhole jumps, and dock at the nearest station

I'm shaking, sweating, realising just how much of a coin flip that escape was, but besides some battered armour and some overheating damage on my modules, we're both safe, sound, with my ship and Carbon's ancient relics out of harms way


We chat for a bit, they tell me they'd only been a capsuleer for a few days, and were hoping to fly a ship just like mine in the future
So I offer to swap, I take their relics, and leave them my ship


Value for value, I lost out a bit, but it's safer for me to go sell the relics at the nearest trade hub and make my way home in a cheaper ship, and they get to keep the ship that saved them, and either sell it or fly it when they're able to

And with that, we went our separate ways
I hope they flew that ship, bravely or wisely, and that it's inevitable destruction would be as good a story as the story about how they got it
