My playthrough of "Poste-Monstre-Trésor", a roleplaying game designed by [Simon Bachelier](http://www.simonbachelier.com/) and [Diane Landais](http://www.diane-landais.fr/) for [Wish You Were Here: A Postcard Jam](https://itch.io/jam/wish-you-were-here)

## Fuck Deepsleep

<p class="julius">Good morning, esteemed employee
We trust you enjoyed Deepsleep™
Your personalised WAKE-ME-UP™ package:
  Caffeine: 80 mg
  Methylphenidate: 60 mg
  Phenylpiracetam: 100 mg
                 ———
"The <span class="distort">jitters</span> mean it's working time!"</p>

Fuck Deepsleep...  
Feels like someone is taking a sledgehammer right to the base of my skull, every time.

Okay, let's get ourselves docked up and signed out. There's a hot shower and some real coffee waiting for me hubside.

> Julius, give me the sit-rep.  
> How are we doing on decel?

<p class="julius">Situation report:
  Collision detected

Oh...   
Wait... Why are we *anywhere near* a planet?  
Collision with *what*? We're on a veil run!  

Er... Hostile... life form?

> Julius, are we getting jacked?  
> How did a pirate ambush not show up on scan?

<p class="julius">No other ships on scan
The lifeform is non-human</p>

> Julius, can I... Use the gun, please?

<p class="julius">Weapons request: PENDING</p>

> Great... Keep me posted...  
> Love the interaction between adrenalin and WAKE-ME-UP, by the way. Guess it's working time...

<p class="julius">Your feedback has been noted!</p>

## The crevice

Julius must be confused, probably scanned some of the food supplies as biotics. I hope.  
He's definitely not confused about the gas giant though. We're dropping... Fast...

> Julius, can we stabilise our orbit? We're in some heavy atmosphere, I don't think that's doing our engines any good, right?

<p class="julius">
Engine status:
  Main: Unfueled (c.f: Cargo status)

Retrograde?  
Oh for fuck's sake... Guess we need to scoop the cargo anyway...  

> Okay, let me strap up, and drop us in...

I hate atmospherics, this is exactly why I signed up for veil runs... Can I apply for an advanced navigation bonus at least?  
Ugh, the Piracetam's kicking in... Let's try to keep the stomach under control, too.  

The whole ship is groaning. It *was* built for this kind of op, but corporate doesn't exactly take care of this fleet. How long has it been since the last chassis checkup?

Actually, best not think about that right now...

<p class="julius">Orbit stabilised.
WARNING: AUX ENGINE TEMP: 873 C
Atmosphere:
  Light wind, matched prograde velocity
  Nitrogen/Sulphuric acid/Argon mix

&lt; Continue retrograde burn ? &gt;
&lt; <span class="distort">Stabilise systems ?</span> &gt;
</p>

> Let's chill here for a bit.  
> Pump some coolant into the engines and keep us in this calm spot, yeah?

Okay, this isn't too bad... Aux engines seem to be working fine, despite the vibrations and overheating.  
If I can scoop up the cargo, we can relight the main engine and get us out of this atmosphere, I guess.  
But first, I want to keep those temps under control.

> Julius, I'm going to take a moment to run some check-ups, let me know when aux is back under... say... two hundred degrees?

## Of course we're off course

<p class="julius">NOTIFY: Aux engine temp: 198 C
WARNING: DISTANCE TO CARGO CRITICAL</p>

> The fuck you mean, distance critical?  
> Julius! Why didn't you tell me we were drifting! We need that cargo to get out of this piece of shit atmosphere!  
> Get us back on course, now!

> Approve! Approve!

I can't believe this, Julius is supposed to be the big brain here. I never said "only notify me about this one thing", how the hell am I expected to work like this?

Eight thousand delta-v? This better work, the auxiliary engines are going to be *toast*. And I'm going to be sitting out here for weeks without Deepsleep if I can't relight the main thruster.  

I *HATE* the sound of the hull creaking under thrust.

## Hostile lifeform

<p class="julius">WARNING: HOSTILE LIFEFORM APPROACHING
Closing in:

Wait, it's moving? Did I pick up a stowaway on our last stop?  
I'm going to have to fight this asshole, aren't I?
