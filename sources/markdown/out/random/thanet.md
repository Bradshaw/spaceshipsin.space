## Thanet Storm Damage

The British side of my family is mostly based in Thanet, and I picked up this photobook when visiting as a child.  
I stumbled on it while going through some of my old stuff the other day, and I figured other people might be interested.   

This photobook documents the extent of the damage due to a storm in 1978, damaging infrastructure and property in the towns of Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs.
