# The Adept
Their eyes flit around the room, absorbing details, making correlations. The words they speak are carefully chosen to burrow deep into their listener's mind. Information is key, a currency, a weapon, the paintbrush of reality.   
The **Adept** can focus their mind to an infinitesimal point, or expand their thoughts to engulf everything. They attune to patterns hidden in their surroundings, nature, culture, psychology.
