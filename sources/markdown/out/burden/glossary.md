## Around the game

### TTRPG

A **TTRPG** (**T**able **T**op **R**ole-**P**laying **G**ame) is a blend of board game and cooperative storytelling.

While some TTRPGs may differ greatly, most follow a similar design:
They're played in a group of about four to eight people.
One person acts as a guide/referee/narrator, often called the **Game Master** or **GM**. In Burden, this person is called the **Guide**.
The others take on a single character's role, they're called **Player**s.

The Guide is responsible for setting the stage, bringing life to other characters, interpreting the outcomes of player actions, dictating the flow of the session, and moving the narrative along.

The Players decide how their character reacts to the events in the story, what actions they take, and act out the dialogue and scenes their character takes part in.

TTRPGs have rules to guide the story and determine how successful the player characters are in their adventures. Typically, this involves throwing dice to simulate risk and unpredictability. Burden is no exception.

### Table

A **Table** in the context of **TTRPG**s is the collective word for the group of people, Guide and Players, who are playing together.
Every group of people is unique. As such, every table is unique.

When you play a TTRPG, your experience and enjoyment will depend on the *vibes* of the table you join more so than the rules or setting of the game you're playing.
