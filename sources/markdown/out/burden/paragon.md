# The Paragon
As their foot touches the ground, the silence is almost deafening. Their muscles twitch into motion fractions of a second before contact, their toes recoil in anticipation, their knee flexes with absurd precision. Carrying a load that would bring others to their knees, the **Paragon** seems unaffected, running uphill with disconcerting ease.   
   
The **Paragon** is strength and power, grace and agility, energy and endurance. Whether through arduous training, a fluke of genetics, a marvel of medicine, or something else, their body operates at the limit of what is thought possible.  
A finely tuned machine, the raw power of eons of biological progress, the **Paragon** knows exactly what their body is capable of. Mountains become small, obstacles become brittle, distances shink.  
  
The **Paragon** is fast, strong, quiet, and robust, undeniable assets when travelling the shifting lands.  
A sound **Paragon** maintains their body in perfect condition, after all, the body is the only link between their soul and the world.
