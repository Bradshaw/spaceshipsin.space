### Fragment

A disembodied consciousness, gripping onto reality while it still can.

This is a special archetype that is only available when an agent dies.

If you die as a Fragment, burn your character sheet. Your allies might no longer remember you. Next session, create a new character with no Remnants.

#### Imprint

*Whenever*
You imprint yourself upon an ally and choose one of your Remnants, they gain access to that Remnant as long as you remain imprinted upon them.
You may also communicate speak telepathically with your host, or speak out loud in Realspace using their voice.

You may only imprint yourself upon one ally at a time. You may sever the connection at any time by succeeding on a Standard Pressure Beyond roll.
- Fiasco: You remain imprinted. You and your host take a Beyond Scar each.
- Mixed: You detach from your host, but you take a Beyond Scar.
- Success: You detach from your host.
- Critical: You detach from your host, but they retain access to the Remnant you imparted upon them for the rest of the investigation.

#### Passage: Bind

Choose a non-player character to possess, then describe how you attemp remove the consciousness from their body to take its place. Make an appropriate Beyond action roll.
The difficulty depends on the target's disposition:
- Willing - Trivial
- Unaware - Standard
- Guarded - Difficult
- Hostile - Extreme

The efficacy of the binding depends on the result:
- Fiasco: The target's consciousness stands strong. You die.
- Mixed: The body is mostly yours, your memories are bland, overpowered by the aftertaste of your target. Your Remnants are lost. The Administrator picks a new Remnant representing traces of the target's consciousness.
- Success: The body is yours. Randomly select up to d4 Remnants to keep.
- Critical: The body is yours. Choose up to d4 Remnants to keep.
