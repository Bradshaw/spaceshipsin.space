*Once per investigation*
When you roll a Fiasco, a nearby ally may intervene before the roll is resolved. Gain +1 to that skill rating for the rest of the investigation.

#### Beginner's luck

*Passive*
You gain advantage when looking for clues or inconsistencies.

#### Passage: Step up to the plate

Automatically succeed on an action.
You have no archetype for the rest of the investigation. If you gained a +1 from "Fucking new guy", lose it.
Gain "By the book".
Choose a new archetype when the investigation ends.

#### Remnant: By the book

*Once per investigation*
When you and your allies are planning, suggest a course of action within PCTF guidelines and regulations.
If this suggestion is accepted by the party, each other agent chooses whether to "trust" or "doubt" the plan.
When the next action roll in service of the plan is made:
- Fiasco / Mixed: Agents who doubted the plan gain advantage on their next roll.
- Success / Critical: Agents who trusted the plan gain advantage on their next roll.
