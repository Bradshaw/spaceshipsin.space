### Veteran

You've seen it all. You've seen too much. It's time for someone else to take your place. Someone younger. Someone who hasn't yet lost their spark..

Special equipment:
- Lucky charm - *Resist +1*
  - A personal item that you religiously keep with you at all times ever since "the incident"
- Optional: Manusomme MS77 Revolver - *Pressure +3 / Force +1*
  - A fearsome-looking hunk of metal with a wooden grip that fits *just right* in your calloused hands
  - Heavy and unwieldy, but you know that the best shot is one you don't have to take
  - Replaces your Becker & Wolfe G909

#### Too old for this shit

*Once per investigation.*
You automatically succeed on an action by narrating an alternative solution that doesn't require as much effort.

#### Wasn't born yesterday

*Passive*
Gain advantage on rolls when attempting to detect lies, dissimulation, or subterfuge.

#### Passage: Just one last case

You heroically sacrifice yourself to automatically succeed on an action.
Allies who witnessed your sacrifice gain +2 to all rolls for the rest of the scene.

Create a new "Recruit" character with "I'll never fill those shoes" who joins the investigation as soon as possible.

#### Remnant: I'll never fill those shoes / One of us

**I'll never fill those shoes**: After a scene where you excelled and proved your worth, an ally who worked with the Veteran you replaced may give you "One of us". Lose this trait.

**One of us**: Allies who worked with the Veteran gain advantage when protecting you, and you gain advantage when protecting them.
