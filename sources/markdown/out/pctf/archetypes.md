# Archetypes

At any given time, agents embody a single archetype. They also carry "remnant" traits from previous archetypes they have embodied.

## Occupation

Occupation archetypes are jobs, roles, and specialisations that an agent takes on. They provide access to the core skills and equipment required to carry out the duties that are expected of a PCTF agent.

### Beyond

The PCTF seeks out people who have an affinity for the Beyond. Agents who specialise in the Beyond are essential to the task of investigating crimes that involve paranormal phenomena.

#### Manipulator

Manipulators are trained in the art of projecting their will into or through the Beyond. They are taught how to shape paranormal phenomena and act within the Beyond in relative safety.
