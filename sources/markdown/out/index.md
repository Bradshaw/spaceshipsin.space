## Things
Projects I've worked on or am a part of

### void.garden [→](https://voidgarden.itch.io/)
![void.garden logo](voidgarden.700w.jpg)
[void.garden](http://void.garden/) is a project/collective that aims to develop art, events, media and stuff, all tangential to video games. [more](https://voidgarden.itch.io/)

### l'indécadence [→](https://voidgarden.itch.io/lindecadence)
L'indécadence was an indie games & art party taking place during IndieCade Europe in Paris. Nine games and four musicians were on the lineup. We featured colourful and unconventional projects from around the world. Relive the event through [Anna-Céléstine's](https://twitter.com/lafilledct) photo gallery [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lafilledct/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1471957822887747).

### .lazr. [→](https://gaeel.itch.io/lazr)
![".lazr." text on a dark CRT screen](lazr.700w.jpg)
.lazr. is a local multiplayer arena shooter with deliciously glitchy visuals. Up to four players using standard XBox controllers face off in a number of game modes. This was made in part as a homage to Warsow "insta-gib" deathmatch games, with one-hit kills, weapon-based movement, and easy to learn, hard to master mechanics. [play](https://gaeel.itch.io/lazr)

### Prepare to Meet Thy God [→](http://shakethatbutton.com/prepare-to-meet-thy-god/)
The title and the original idea were inspired by [this photo, titled "The Long Walk"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal#/media/File:Eod_technician_ireland.jpg)
Prepare to Meet Thy God is an installation where the user is equipped with protective gear and an explosive ordinance disposal kit, and sent, alone, into a room where they'll have to find and defuse a bomb. The screen of the bomb includes clues as to the process to defuse it, but also threatening and disturbing messages. A camera films the user and the bomb, recording their every movement, but for the user, they're terribly alone, with only the weight of responsibility.

### The Paper Sail [→](https://papersail.lab.arte.tv/)
![A paper boat on a screen](papersail.700w.jpg)
A collaboration with [Cosmografik](http://cosmografik.fr/), The Paper Sail is a meditative experience where the user places a small paper sail on their touch-capable device (phone, tablet, Cintiq, etc…), and then explores a quiet archipelago. They'll meet insects, fish, and occasionally, another traveller. [play](https://papersail.lab.arte.tv/)

## The Future
Projects and ideas I'm working on or looking to start

### Mind Thief [→](https://twitter.com/_gaeel_/status/1080566801237454851)
![The Sentinel, emerging inside a hall of colums](thief.700w.jpg)
A virtual reality experience inspired by the [Raymarching Toolkit](https://kev.town/raymarching-toolkit/) by [Kevin Watters](https://kev.town/) and [Fernando Ramallo](https://fernandoramallo.github.io/2018/).
Raymarching allows for dynamic shapes that move and twist in uncanny ways, and when I started building a simple scene. [more](https://twitter.com/_gaeel_/status/1080566801237454851)
