# Hello!
My name is __Gaeel&nbsp;Bradshawâ€‘Rodriguez__

I am a designer and programmer, interested in interactivity, digital art, and computer-enabled experiences. If you're working on something weird, fun, thoughtful, or rebellious, I'd like to help you make that thing happen!

I like to [make digital art](/nebulae), [write stories](/random/spacefarer), and [play with electronic music](/things/olegtron4060).

I also like playing, running, and designing table-top roleplaying games. I'm currently working on [**Veil Runners**](/veil-runners), a rules-light roleplaying game that takes place in a galaxy scarred by a mysterious anomaly known as "The Veil".
