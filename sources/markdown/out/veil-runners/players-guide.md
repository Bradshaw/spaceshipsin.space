# Veil Runners â€” Player's Guide

This document is intended for the **players** in a [Veil Runners](/veil-runners) adventure, and assumes that you are a player.
If you're the **wayfinder**, you might want to print this page out to hand to your players.

## The Veil, your ship, and you

You are a crew member, aboard a light starship. The ship is your home, your workplace, your means of transportation, and in many ways, an extension of yourself.
You share this ship with your crew mates. You and your mates are also, in many ways, part of your ship; not unlike the machines, reactors, and computers that power it.

Your ship is a "Veil Runner". It is small and agile. It is kitted out with powerful sensors and computers. It has special hardening against the volatile hazards of The Veil.

The Veil is an unstable region of space that has torn through the Orion arm of the galaxy. During your adventures, you will explore this anomalous space, you will encounter inexplicable phenomena. You might learn a little about the nature of the Veil, or at the very least, about yourself.

     - a reflection of your intent during your travels

### Creating your character
This part is a little more personal, you are responsible for your own character and get to decide alone how to write them.
