# Veil Runners

**Veil Runners** is a (very much work-in-progress) TTRPG about a starship and its crew, diving deep into the Veil, an unstable region of space that has torn through the Orion arm of the galaxy.

This page is a placeholder for now.
**Veil Runners** started as a hack of [Rust Skunks](/rust-skunks), another work-in-progress TTRPG. It keeps the concept of centering the story around a vehicle and its crew. Aside from the change in setting and tone, Veil Runners drops Rust Skunks' "Rig Running" scenes, and introduces sci-fi starship systems management mechanics.
