### Game materials

#### Die/dice

## Basic mechanics

### Rolling dice

1. **Set Difficulty Target**: The wayfinder sets 1, 2, or 3 as the target.
2. **Build Dice Pool**: Start with your vitality dice. For ship system rolls, add relevant system dice. For EVA rolls, add relevant equipment dice.
3. **Determine Hit Target**: Starts at 6, but can be reduced to 3 by invoking skills, ship modules, etc.
4. **Roll and Count Hits**: Roll the dice pool, counting dice that meet or beat the hit target.
5. **Determine Outcome**:
   - **Success**: Hits > difficulty target.
   - **Complication**: Hits = difficulty target.
   - **Fiasco**: Hits < difficulty target.
6. **Restitute Dice**: See [dice restitution](#dice-restitution)
7. **Interpret Outcome**: See [outcomes](#outcomes)

#### Dice Restitution:

- For Ship System Roll:
  - Return vitality dice.
  - Success: Return system dice and perform full remap. 
  - Complication: Return system dice to the ship, mapped at will. 
  - Fiasco: Return system dice to original system
    - Desperate roll: The ship [takes damage](#taking-damage).

- For EVA Roll:
  - Equipment dice are spent.
  - Failure on Desperate Roll: Lose one vitality die. 
  - Otherwise: Return all vitality dice.

#### Outcomes

**Success** means that the players' action goes as planned. This doesn't necessarily mean that the players obtain exactly what they want; sometimes the plan isn't sufficient to achieve the desired outcome.
In any case, a success should advance the story in a way that advances the players toward their overall goals.

**Failure** means that not only did the players' action not go as planned, but the attempt causes unwanted or unexpected consequences.
It is important to keep the story moving. Failure might have closed some doors, but others should open. Introduce new threats, shift priorities, 

### Taking damage

When the ship **takes damage**:
- If the ship has the **integrity token**:
  - Remove the **integrity token**
  - No further damage is done
- If the ship has the **engineering token**
  - The crew can decide to spend the **engineering token** to avoid a potential **system crash**
  - If they do so:
    - Remove the **engineering token**
    - No further damage is done
- **System crash!**
  - Roll a die:
    - 1-4:
      - Destroy the module with that number
      - If it has already been destroyed, destroy the ship, the adventure ends here
    - 5-6: No further damage is done
