# Rust, Fuel & Flesh

A loud and dirty table-top role-playing game about grease monkeys with fuel to burn and an axle to grind.
This game is intended for four players and a guide.
The players are the grimy, driven crew of a rig, running away from a grimy past, towards a future of opportunity.
They'll race in cut-throat rallies, carry deliveries across dangerous terrain, and somehow seem to have an ever-growing horde of enemies chasing them down.

## Let's burn some fuel

Eighteen studded all-terrain wheels.
Twin sixteen-cylinder quad-turbo engines.
Forty-four tons of rusted metal, fuel and flesh.
A machine made of fire and rage, tearing through the dirt at eighty knots.

|  1  | The rig's rightful owner isn't far behind, they want it back, and you dead                        |
|  2  | The last round of repairs cost more than you could afford, the creditor expects payment this week |
|  3  | You made a promise to a local Baron, and you have no idea how to fulfill it                       |
|  4  | You've made a lot of people angry, it's time to find a way out of this turf                       |
|  5  | You're carrying contraband, it would be wise to offload it soon                                   |
|  6  | There's a bounty on your heads, your only choice is to keep moving, for now                       |

*Roll a die to choose your opening scene, or discuss with your group what greasy situation you're tied up in at the start of your story.*

## Who are you?

Fate has bound you together on this monstrous screaming machine. A rig like this needs a hard-working, fearless crew to keep charging forwards, and when behind you there are only creditors and mistakes, and ahead of you a fresh road of opportunity, where else would you want to go?

You are individuals, each with your skills and experience, your flaws and baggage.
You are comrades, maybe even friends, perhaps? You need each other, for companionship, to survive.
You are machine parts, not unlike the wheels, engines, and pumps, powering your rig, your home.

### As individuals

Choose your background.
*(Roll a die, pick from the table, or come up with your own. Write it down.)*

| ðŸŽ²  | Background                                                                          |
|:---:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A criminal on the run. The long arm of "the law" will catch up to you one day.      |
|  2  | A wanderer travelling for no reason at all. You've never had companions before.     |
|  3  | A worker looking to make enough money to someday go home and make it all better.    |
|  4  | A daredevil seeking thrills. Anything that's loud enough to drown out the pain.     |
|  5  | A nerd with a deep understanding of machines. So much easier than *people*.         |
|  6  | A hero making the world a better place. It's easier to fix the world than yourself. |

What do you look like?
Were you once wealthy?
Are you grizzled and worn, but wise with experience, or an inexperienced child, full of energy and hope?
How much of your body is still made of flesh and bone?
What do you carry with you? How much of it is replaceable?
Do you have scars or tattoos? Do they have stories? Do you remember those stories? Who would you be willing to tell them to?
*(You can write the answers down if you like. Ask yourself more questions, maybe?)*

When fate comes knocking and everything is against you, what skill can you rely upon? What single thing can you honestly claim to be your best quality?
*(Write it down, and tag it with **Skill**.)*

What is the flaw that will almost certainly spell your doom? What is the crack in glass that will cause everything to shatter?
*(Write it down, and tag it with **Flaw**.)*

### As comrades

Decide how you all came to be together aboard your rig.
Did you know each other before boarding?
Had you lost sight of each other for a while?
Was the reunion a happy one?
Are you all here by choice?
Do you trust each other?
No, really. Do you *actually* trust each other?
Do you know each other's secrets?
Would you kill for each other?
Would you *die* for each other?
When this is all done and dusted, will you stick around?
*(You can write the answers down if you like. Ask yourself more questions, maybe?)*

Choose another member of the crew, and write down something you hope for them. It can be positive or negative.
Maybe you'd like to see them open up and enjoy life, or maybe you think they ought to face *some* justice for what they've done.
*(Write it down, and tag it with **Bond**.)*

### As machine parts

A rig needs a crew.
Everyone on the crew knows how to do all the jobs, in a pinch, but you have your specialty, your role.

- **Driver**: Hands on the wheel, feet on the pedals, head in the game. You can feel the momentum of your rig. Your seat connects you to the chassis, to the suspension, to the wheels, to the ground. Every stone, bump, and patch of loose soil translates to micro-corrections in the steering.
- **Spotter**: Crawling up on the roof, binoculars in hand. Swinging around the hull checking for damage and intruders. Smelling the fumes blown your way by the wind and figuring out what kinds of vehicle are up ahead. You sniff out opportunities and dangers alike.
- **Machinist**: Deep in the guts of the rig, metal, fuel and oil churn away relentlessly. To most, it's a dirty cacophony, but to you, this is an orchestra, and you're the maestro. You know how to push the engine to its limits. Its *actual* limits, not the ones written in the manual.
- **Wrench**: You make broken things fixed and fixed things broken. "Tool" kit in hand, you dash around the rig mending damage and fighting off intruders. Occasionally, you might even hop onto your pursuers' rigs for some light sabotage and intimidation.
*(Decide together who does what, write it down, and tag it with **Job**.)*
